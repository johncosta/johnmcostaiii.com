## Overview

I recently came across a couple of posts on LinkedIn[^1][^2] that got me thinking about how I can use GPT to better understand my cognitive, emotional, and relational architecture. The post discusses how GPT can be used to create a mind map of your life, which can help you identify patterns and connections in your thoughts and feelings.

I decided to give it a try and see what I could come up with. I used GPT to generate a mind map of my life, focusing on my cognitive, emotional, and relational architecture. The results were fascinating and provided me with a new perspective on myself.

The prompt I used was:

```
I want to better understand my cognitive, emotional, and relational architecture - how my mind works, how I process the world, and what makes me thrive. Based on our conversations, patterns in how I think, and the way I talk through problems, generate a structured table that maps out my internal wiring.

Categories should include:

Guiding Force
Core Personality
Superpowers
Growth Edges
Cognitive Architecture
Emotional Architecture
Relational Architecture

For each one, include a short description (how I experience it) and a ‘How It Shows Up’ column (real-life traits or behaviors that others might notice).

Make it sound like me. Use natural language, vivid but clear phrasing, and focus on insight, not fluff.
```

Curious what you think! I found this exercise to be incredibly insightful and a great way to reflect on my personal
development journey. If you're interested in trying it out, I encourage you to give it a go and see what insights you
can uncover about yourself.
