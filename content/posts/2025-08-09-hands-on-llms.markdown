## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book *Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Large-Language-Models-Understanding/dp/1098150961/ref=sr_1_1?crid=15YBR96UBIYVO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1MUa46N8Y9QCki_IGnTl1T74Har-XhvVDPrysPvNR91xqhLJ0sa-Lo-hzP8m6d-7TpzEgATkhmTWKs03BoS-hwEDOJ8UNAbOsba1a0BABT9oO-kIgklm0IKct4itnWyfOMEHSECNerQ8lx8b7VWiJ-5PukzhjKCj-iJ4UrO5PhGrgMySfYZpbhYrIkEA4_JA1Yue47syrAZu414pHVdcuttxPG1hP48SxE3ZSj-3p74.Shfm-6xfdF4SfUvNKSbVNEcQM4rC4skcwznK4nbS-NM&dib_tag=se&keywords=hands+on+large+language+models&qid=1754755424&sprefix=Hands+on%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-1)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: An Introduction to Large Language Models

Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the recent history of Large Language Models (LLMs). The diagrams in this chapter
are particularly useful for understanding the evolution of LLMs and how they relate to other AI technologies. It's a
great segway from the machine learning and neural networks covered in the [previous book I'm reading in parallel](https://johnmcostaiii.com/posts/2025-08-07-ai-ml-learning/).

## Taxonomy

__Large Language Models (LLMs)__: A type of AI model that is trained on large datasets to understand and generate human language.
__Bag of Words (BoW)__: A simple representation of text that ignores grammar and word order but keeps track of word frequency.
__word2vec__: A technique that uses neural networks to learn word embeddings, capturing semantic relationships between words.
__Attention__: A mechanism that allows models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving context understanding.
__GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)__: A type of LLM that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and can generate coherent text based on a given prompt.
