## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, and Ruth Malan.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959/?bestFormat=true&k=the%20mythical%20man-month%20by%20fred%20brooks&ref_=nb_sb_ss_w_scx-ent-bk-ww_k2_1_18_de&crid=1TQ3Z724DK40&sprefix=Mythical%20Man%20Month)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.
