## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, and Ruth Malan.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959/?bestFormat=true&k=the%20mythical%20man-month%20by%20fred%20brooks&ref_=nb_sb_ss_w_scx-ent-bk-ww_k2_1_18_de&crid=1TQ3Z724DK40&sprefix=Mythical%20Man%20Month)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: The Tar Pit

Programming Systems Product
- Programming Product costs ~3x as much as a debugged program w/ same function

The Joys of the Craft
1) Making Things
2) Making things that are useful
3) Fashioning complex puzzle-like objects
4) Always learning
5) Delight of medium

The Woes of the Craft
1) Perfection
2) Other people's objectives
3) Other people's systems
4) finding bugs is work
5) product appears obsolete before finished

Challenge and Mission: to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.

## Chapter 2: The Mythical Man-Month

Calendar Time Causes Issues
1) Estimating is poorly developed
2) Estimating techniques confuses effort with progress
3) Estimates are uncertain
4) Schedule progress is poorly monitored
5) Natural Reaction to Schedule Slippage is to add manpower

Optimism: All programmers are optimists

Creative activities:
1) idea
2) implementation
3) interaction

Incompleteness and Inconsistencies become clear during implementation.

### The man-month

Cost = # of programmers * number of months

The bearing of a child takes 9 months, no matter how many women are assigned.

Project Planning Rules:
- 1/3 Planning
- 1/6 Coding
- 1/4 component/system test
- 1/4 system test

### Gutless Estimating

- Develop and Publicize productivity Figures
- bug-incidence figures
- estimating rules

Brook's Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
