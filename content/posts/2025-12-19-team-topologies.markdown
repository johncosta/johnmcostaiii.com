## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, and Ruth Malan.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-2nd-Organizing-Technology/dp/1966280009/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VXRQ2OVRD5S5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gUnp5Llb6G2C9VhS6aYZU0921p5NeTzDBzb599Z2duQWa-1wABwNUGkiHUxtroDhpfYn_fjxDXsCH535W0XHZzmEC5AgckENaVGXypMGpo4iIr_omSRhQ4_AFnDV45qa-carRbnPEjBsmHrw39PIgrRIn_wqj6cjtVZR17WvDVtXm5Qid-1PC2TCCPDMf35kV0fYjJervUPMkRNBn1VcQohCSdVqCQlKfvs3hsfZhtI.aTH1WV1MxUw7mMJJNw_Nhl1FrFNFO3Sgs_pXaaKnbNk&dib_tag=se&keywords=team+topologies&qid=1766144885&sprefix=team+top%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-1)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: The problem with org charts

Overview:
- Conway's law: Software architecture and team structure are similar forces
- Team Topologies
  - clarifies team purpose and responsibilities
  - Humanistic approach to building software systems

There are 4 fundamental team types:
1. Stream-aligned team
2. Enabling team
3. Complicated subsystem team
4. Platform team

Team structures must match the desired software architecture.

Cognitive Load: The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.

When cognitive load exceeds a team's capacity, it leads to burnout and reduced productivity.

Obstacles to fast flow:
- blockers
- disengaged teams
- pushing against conways law
- software too big for teams
- confusing org design
- team pulled in too many directions
- Painful re-orgs

## Chapter 2: Conways Law and why it matters

Overview:
- Conway's law: organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure
- organization constraints impact software architecture
- everyone communicating with everyone is not scaleable
- choose team structures that align with desired software architecture
- limiting communication paths improves flow

Team assignments are the first draft of the architecture.

For a safe rapid flow of change, team structures must align with the desired software architecture.

Not all communication and collaboration is good.

Repeated re-orgs damage team morale and productivity, create fiefdoms, and lead to loss of institutional knowledge.

Conways law is a fundamental principle that must be considered when designing both software systems and organizational structures.
