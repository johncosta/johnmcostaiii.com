## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book In this Economy? How money & Markes Really Work.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=in+this+economy+kyla+scanlon&crid=1Z5SRG3W9VB43&sprefix=In+this+eco%2Caps%2C184&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_11)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: The Economic Kingdom

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of the "Economic Kingdom," which is a framework for understanding how money and markets
operate in our society.

The chapter discusses the following key concepts:

* Monetary Policy Castle: Manages the entire kingdom and is owned by the Federal Reserve. Generally in charge of inflation
and the labor market.
* US Dollar Castle: Secret weapon of Monetary Policy Castle.
* The Commodity Castle: Basic goods used by everyone.

Contractionary monetary policy: things slow down, people don't spend, people loose jobs
Expansionary monetary policy: things speed up, people spend, people get jobs






## Taxonomy

* Inflation: rise in prices that create a decrease in purchasing power.
