## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book In this Economy? How money & Markes Really Work.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=in+this+economy+kyla+scanlon&crid=1Z5SRG3W9VB43&sprefix=In+this+eco%2Caps%2C184&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_11)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: The Economic Kingdom

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of the "Economic Kingdom," which is a framework for understanding how money and markets
operate in our society.

The chapter discusses the following key concepts:

* Monetary Policy Castle: Manages the entire kingdom and is owned by the Federal Reserve. Generally in charge of inflation
and the labor market.
* US Dollar Castle: Secret weapon of Monetary Policy Castle.
* The Commodity Castle: Basic goods used by everyone.

Contractionary monetary policy: things slow down, people don't spend, people loose jobs
Expansionary monetary policy: things speed up, people spend, people get jobs

## Chapter 2: The Vibe Economy

Chapter 2 begins by explaining the relationship of households and businesses and the flow of resources.

**__Note__**: The book offers a diagram that illustrates the flow of money between households and businesses.

Households:
  Inputs:
    - Income
    - Buying Goods & Services
  Outputs:
    - Spending
    - Land, Labor, Capital

    Businesses:
        Inputs:
            - Resources
            - Revenue
        Outputs:
            - Selling Goods & Services
            - Wages, Rent, Profit

Fuel Vibes:

    Fuel: As gasoline prices rise, consumer sentiment tends to decrease.

    Higher prices make us feel bad => if we feel bad, the economy feels bad

Oil Market influenced by:
    - how much oil is being produced
  - how many people are consuming oil

Sentiment drives the economy:
  - If people feel good, they spend more money
  - If people feel bad, they spend less money

Sentiment is influenced by emotions. These emotions are summarized in varius theories:

* Prospect Theory
* Framing Effect
* Anchoring and Adjustment
* Endowment Effect
* Regret Theory
* Intertemporal Choice Theory
* Affective Forcasting
* Social Identity Theory
* Consumer Emotional Engagement

Reflexivity: The idea that the economy is influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs about it, which can create a feedback loop.

1) Initial Perception/Believe
2) Market Action Based on Perception/Believe
3) Refliexive Feedback Loop
4) Bubble Bursts

Benefits of reflexivity to companies:

1) attracts investments based on expectations of future growth
2) gain critical edge in hiring top talent

What is sentiment?

Expectations
Theory
Reality

How we feel X How everyone else feels = Sentiment

Consumer Confidence Survey is an example of consumer sentiment measurement

## Taxonomy

* Inflation: rise in prices that create a decrease in purchasing power.
* OPEC: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a group of oil-producing countries that coordinate their oil production and pricing.
* Sentiment: the overall attitude or feeling of consumers and businesses towards the economy, which can influence spending and investment decisions.
* Prospect Theory: a behavioral economic theory that describes how people make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than absolute outcomes.
* Framing Effect: a cognitive bias where people react differently to the same information depending on how it is presented or framed.
* Anchoring and Adjustment: a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive (the "anchor") when making decisions, and then make adjustments based on that anchor.
* Endowment Effect: a cognitive bias where people value something more highly simply because they own it, leading to a reluctance to sell or trade it.
* Regret Theory: a behavioral economic theory that suggests people anticipate regret when making decisions and may avoid choices that could lead to regret, even if those choices are rational.
* Intertemporal Choice Theory: a behavioral economic theory that examines how people make decisions about trade-offs between immediate and delayed rewards, often leading to preferences for immediate gratification over long-term benefits.
* Affective Forcasting: a cognitive bias where people predict their future emotional states based on current feelings, which can lead to inaccurate predictions about how they will feel in the future.
* Social Identity Theory: a psychological theory that explains how individuals derive their self-concept and identity from their group memberships, influencing their behavior and decision-making.
* Consumer Emotional Engagement: the emotional connection and involvement that consumers have with a brand or product, which can influence their purchasing decisions and loyalty.
