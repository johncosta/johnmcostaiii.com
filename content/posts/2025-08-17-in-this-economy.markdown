## Overview

This post contains my notes on the book In this Economy? How money & Markes Really Work.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=in+this+economy+kyla+scanlon&crid=1Z5SRG3W9VB43&sprefix=In+this+eco%2Caps%2C184&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_11)

I'll be adding my notes to this post as I read through the book. The notes will be organized by chapter and will include key concepts, code examples, and any additional insights I find useful.

## Chapter 1: The Economic Kingdom

Chapter 1 introduces the concept of the "Economic Kingdom," which is a framework for understanding how money and markets
operate in our society.

The chapter discusses the following key concepts:

* Monetary Policy Castle: Manages the entire kingdom and is owned by the Federal Reserve. Generally in charge of inflation
and the labor market.
* US Dollar Castle: Secret weapon of Monetary Policy Castle.
* The Commodity Castle: Basic goods used by everyone.

Contractionary monetary policy: things slow down, people don't spend, people loose jobs
Expansionary monetary policy: things speed up, people spend, people get jobs

## Chapter 2: The Vibe Economy

Chapter 2 begins by explaining the relationship of households and businesses and the flow of resources.

**__Note__**: The book offers a diagram that illustrates the flow of money between households and businesses.

Households:
  Inputs:
    - Income
    - Buying Goods & Services
  Outputs:
    - Spending
    - Land, Labor, Capital

    Businesses:
        Inputs:
            - Resources
            - Revenue
        Outputs:
            - Selling Goods & Services
            - Wages, Rent, Profit

Fuel Vibes:

    Fuel: As gasoline prices rise, consumer sentiment tends to decrease.

    Higher prices make us feel bad => if we feel bad, the economy feels bad

Oil Market influenced by:
    - how much oil is being produced
  - how many people are consuming oil

Sentiment drives the economy:
  - If people feel good, they spend more money
  - If people feel bad, they spend less money

Sentiment is influenced by emotions. These emotions are summarized in varius theories:

* Prospect Theory
* Framing Effect
* Anchoring and Adjustment
* Endowment Effect
* Regret Theory
* Intertemporal Choice Theory
* Affective Forcasting
* Social Identity Theory
* Consumer Emotional Engagement

Reflexivity: The idea that the economy is influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs about it, which can create a feedback loop.

1) Initial Perception/Believe
2) Market Action Based on Perception/Believe
3) Refliexive Feedback Loop
4) Bubble Bursts

Benefits of reflexivity to companies:

1) attracts investments based on expectations of future growth
2) gain critical edge in hiring top talent

What is sentiment?

Expectations
Theory
Reality

How we feel X How everyone else feels = Sentiment

Consumer Confidence Survey is an example of consumer sentiment measurement

## Chapter 3: The Weird World of Money

What is Money?

* A store of value
* A unit of account
* A medium of exchange

Evolution of money:

- Growth of societies and contact with other civiliations led to the need for a common medium of exchange.
- Barter System: Direct exchange of goods and services without using money.
- Example: Is a bag of grain worth 15 cows or 10 cows?
- Coins solved the problem of barter by providing a standardized medium of exchange.

American Currency:

1700s: American colonies depend on European currencies (piece of eight)
1775: Continental Congress issues Continental Currency to fund the Revolutionary War
1785: Due to inflation, the Continental Currency is replaced by the US dollar

Hamilton's Financial Plan:
- a federal bank that provides credit to the government and businesses
- issue a stable national currency
- safe place to store money

1791: First Bank of the United States is established
1811: First Bank of the United States charter expires, states issue their own currencies
1816: Second Bank of the United States is established
Wildcat Banking Era: state-chartered banks issue their own currencies, leading to instability and bank failures
1863: National Banking Act creates a system of national banks and a national currency, only national banks can issue currency
1971: US dollar is no longer backed by gold, leading to fiat currency

The federal reserve enforces the promise and collective trus in the US dollar.

## Chapter 4: The Mechanics of Modern Money

Banks:
- Gatekeepers of money
- Money business model

US Government:
- Creator of money
- Facilitator of what banks do

How is money created?

1) Issuing coins and notes
2) Through credit markets: issuance of government bonds

Banking Blueprint:

Built on:
- trust
- ability to borrow short (customer deposits)
- lend long (loans)

Fractional Reserve Banking: Banks are allowed to keep a fraction of deposits as reserves and lend out the rest.
- Banks use money, invest in securities, and make loans to earn interest.

Art of Lending: Banks hold a balance sheet of assets and liabilities.
- Assets: loans, securities, reserves
- Liabilities: customer deposits, borrowings
- Net Worth: assets - liabilities

Excess reserves: reserves held by banks above the required minimum.

Hedging: Banks use various strategies to manage risks, like interest rate fluctuations.
Example:
- Interest rate swap: an agreement between two parties to exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount.

How banks fail:

insolvency: liabilities exceed assets
illiquidity: unable to meet short-term obligations

Examples:
- Silicon Valley Bank (SVB): no hedges to protect against downside risk of rising interest rates
- 2008 Financial Crisis: use of Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) led to widespread defaults and bank failures.

Dollar's Reign: Countries worldwide use the US dollar as a reserve currency.
- the dollar's value goes up when there is uncertainty in the global economy as more people want to hold dollars.
- the dollar can be an inflation hedge as it tends to hold its value better than other currencies during inflationary periods.

Structure:
- least nasty alternative
- surplus and deficit national economies
- balance of payments







## Taxonomy

* Fiat Money: currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issues it.
* Inflation: rise in prices that create a decrease in purchasing power.
* OPEC: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a group of oil-producing countries that coordinate their oil production and pricing.
* Sentiment: the overall attitude or feeling of consumers and businesses towards the economy, which can influence spending and investment decisions.
* Prospect Theory: a behavioral economic theory that describes how people make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than absolute outcomes.
* Framing Effect: a cognitive bias where people react differently to the same information depending on how it is presented or framed.
* Anchoring and Adjustment: a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive (the "anchor") when making decisions, and then make adjustments based on that anchor.
* Endowment Effect: a cognitive bias where people value something more highly simply because they own it, leading to a reluctance to sell or trade it.
* Regret Theory: a behavioral economic theory that suggests people anticipate regret when making decisions and may avoid choices that could lead to regret, even if those choices are rational.
* Intertemporal Choice Theory: a behavioral economic theory that examines how people make decisions about trade-offs between immediate and delayed rewards, often leading to preferences for immediate gratification over long-term benefits.
* Affective Forcasting: a cognitive bias where people predict their future emotional states based on current feelings, which can lead to inaccurate predictions about how they will feel in the future.
* Social Identity Theory: a psychological theory that explains how individuals derive their self-concept and identity from their group memberships, influencing their behavior and decision-making.
* Consumer Emotional Engagement: the emotional connection and involvement that consumers have with a brand or product, which can influence their purchasing decisions and loyalty.
